This repository includes a segment of a project I co-led at New Automotive that focused on tracking global electric vehicle (EV) sales.

`swissModules.py` and `swissECC.py`: These Python scripts scraped monthly new car registration data by fuel type and manufacturer for Switzerland. Similar web scrapers were developed for other countries.

`finnishModules.py` and `finnishECC.py`: These Python scripts scraped monthly new car registration data by fuel type and manufacturer for Finland. Similar web scrapers were developed for other countries.

`Plot 1 (Finland).png`: A stacked line chart illustrating new vehicle registrations by fuel type over time for Finland. This chart was part of a Plotly Dash dashboard developed as part of this project.

`Plot 2 (Finland).png`: A line chart illustrating monthly Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales from the top ten BEV manufacturers for Finland. This chart was part of a Plotly Dash dashboard developed as part of this project.

`API.py`: This Python script was used to create a Flask API, which populated country-specific pages on the company’s website through SquareSpace’s custom JavaScript feature.
