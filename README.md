This repository includes a segment of a project I co-led at New Automotive that focuses on tracking global Electric Vehicle (EV) sales.

1). `finnishModules.py` and `finnishECC.py`: These Python scripts scrape monthly new car registration data by fuel type and manufacturer for Finland. Similar web scrapers were developed for other countries.

2). `Plot 1 (Finland)`: A stacked line chart illustrating new vehicle registrations by fuel type over time for Finland. This chart is part of a dashboard that was developed using Python's Plotly and Dash as part of this project.

3). `Plot 2 (Finland)`: A line chart illustrating monthly Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales from the top ten BEV manufacturers for Finland. Again, this chart is part of a dashboard that was developed using Python's Plotly and Dash as part of this project.
